These are personal notes from lazyfoo.net's tutorial for SDL.

Chapter 2:
	1. Instead of have one main funciton, we want to split our code up into bool init(); bool loadMedia(); void close();
	2. SDL surface = an image data type contains pixels of an image along with all data needed to render it.
	3. The following are pointers because we'll be dynamically allocating memory to load images, and more effiecient to reference an image by memory.
	//The window we'll be rendering to
	SDL_Window* gWindow = NULL;
    
	//The surface contained by the window
	SDL_Surface* gScreenSurface = NULL;

	//The image we will load and show on the screen
	SDL_Surface* gHelloWorld = NULL;
	4. SDL_BlitSurface( gHelloWorld, NULL, gScreenSurface, NULL ); ->  calls to SDL_BlitSurface, render to the back buffer, 
	what you see on the screen is the front buffer, so later we have to call SDL_UpdateWindowSurface( gWindow ); after all blits are done.
